# Tweeter

For BYU's CS 340 Software Design Patterns class, we made a Twitter Clone using Android on the front-end then Java and AWS (EC2, S3, API Gateway, Lambdas, SQS, DynamoDB) on the back-end. We learned how to not only make a working full-stack app, but how to design it so you can reuse code and follow best practice.
